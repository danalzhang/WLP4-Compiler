# ðŸ“  WLP4-Compiler

A C++ compiler for the WLP4 programming language, designed to convert WLP4 source code into executable machine instructions. This compiler includes three main stages:

1. Lexical Analysis: Scans and tokenizes source code to produce basic language components (tokens).
2. Syntax Analysis: Parses tokens to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), validating language grammar.
3. Code Generation: Transforms the AST into low-level machine code, generating executable instructions.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of compiler design and implementation, with a focus on parsing, syntax analysis, and code generation in C++.
